As such, my Airbnb\'s are in the 98% of the best Airbnb\'s, between Bill and I. As I travel the world, I may stop in and crash during your stay. So always be prepared for partying!

I knew I had to have it, but as my family grew from 2 to 10 kids, our house just couldn\'t keep up. Instead of selling, I decided to offer it up for tourists and vacationers to truly enjoy the best property (in my mind!) of the Bay Area! Enjoy!!!! (Please don\'t break anything.)',

    desc: 'Hipsters and hip hop, passionate activists and grassroots entrepreneurs—it takes time to peel back all of the layers that make up the city. To truly appreciate Oakland’s diverse culture, spend some time exploring its neighborhoods. You’ll find prideful locals around every corner, whether it’s at the farmers market in Chinatown or a theater in Uptown. Don’t settle in one spot for too long—there’s a lot of ground to cover in Oakland. Read on for your cheat sheet to The Town’s best.\n\nOld Oakland: Though there are Victorians sprinkled throughout Oakland, this slice of preserved late century architecture is brochure-perfect. Many of the buildings within this six-block stretch look fresh off an 1870s remodel. Back in the day, this was the place to be seen in Oakland, the center of hoighty-toighty society, having the best restaurants, shops and hotels on cobble-stoned streets. And it still is—although it took a serious amount of restoring to bring it back from neglect after the 1906 earthquake. Today, indie retail shops are opening. Chefs at informal eateries are cooking up recipes from their old countries, whether that be Mexico, Barbados, Italy or Vietnam. At the old Swan’s Market, a food hall is coming to life with Mexican Cosecha, wine tasting with Periscope Cellars, and Rosamunde’s sausage and beer. The Friday’s farmers market is one of The Town’s best, with all the local characters buying their delicious provisions.',

    desc: 'Seattle is a city of distinct neighbourhoods and urban districts that, though close to one another, change from one street to the next. Some neighbourhoods, notably those near the Duwamish Waterway to southwest of the city centre, are industrial in character, marked by rail yards, wharves, cranes, and low-income housing projects. Others, largely outside the city centre, are showcases for the opulence wrought by Seattle’s booming high-technology sector.\n\nThe downtown district is Seattle’s commercial heart. Of particular interest to visitors is the Pike Place Market, a sheltered area of fresh fish and produce shops, other retail stores, and restaurants. To the east and northeast of the downtown district stand First Hill and Capitol Hill, low bluffs covered by office buildings and commercial properties. Capitol Hill has many stately mansions and is a lively centre for shopping and nightlife. Beyond them are the Central District, the traditional hub of the city’s African American population, and the large residential Madrona neighbourhood, which faces Lake Washington.\n\nTo the north of Pioneer Square, downtown, and the popular neighbourhood of Belltown stands Seattle Center, the 74-acre (30-hectare) site of the 1962 World’s Fair. The centre contains the 605-foot- (184-metre-) high Space Needle, Seattle’s best-known landmark, as well as McCaw Hall (home of the Seattle Opera), Key Arena, the Children’s Museum, the Museum of Pop Culture, and other public buildings. There the high-rise downtown cityscape gives way to the pleasant urban neighbourhoods of Magnolia, which borders Puget Sound, and Queen Anne, located east-southeast of Magnolia between Lake Union, the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and Elliott Bay. South Lake Union was a relatively sleepy area until Amazon.com consolidated all of its offices there in 2010, which led to rapid growth that was partially enabled by a streetcar line that had opened in the neighbourhood in 2007.',
